# AIDI-2004-LAB1

## The program contains code for image classification using deep learning, convolutional neural networks(CNN) using CIFAR-10 dataset
CIFAR-10 is a well-understood dataset and widely used for benchmarking computer vision algorithms in the field of machine learning.  It is relatively straightforward to achieve 80% classification accuracy using traditonal Machine Learning models. Top performance on the problem is achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy above 90% on the test dataset.
This program demonstrates the use of CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset.
